# My First GWT App

## Google Web Toolkit

Google Web Toolkit is an open-source set of tools that allows web developers to create and maintain JavaScript
front-end applications in Java. Other than a few native libraries, everything is Java source that can be built
on any supported platform with the included GWT Ant build files. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

GWT emphasizes reusable approaches to common web development tasks, namely asynchronous remote procedure calls,
history management, bookmarking, UI abstraction, internationalization, and cross-browser portability.


## Installing GWT

[Download](http://www.gwtproject.org/download.html), and unzip GWT to your hard drive.

*Check your IDE for popular plugins. Or download the eclipse version of GWT, if for some reason you use Eclipse IDE.*


## Running This Project

While you should be able to run this project in devmode, you will need to add gwt-users.jar to the classpath to
recognize the symbols from gwt libraries. In Intellij just go to 'project structure' > 'libraries' and press '+'.
Now just navigate to the 'gwt-user.jar' in you GWT installation directory and press 'ok'.


## Generating An App

> .\gwt-2.9.0\webAppCreator -out "C:\Users\Admin\Idea Projects\MyFirstGwtApp" "be.steven.d.dog.MyFirstGwtApp"


## Tutorial

We can find a tutorial on the official webpages [here](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/tutorial/gettingstarted.html).


## Super Dev Mode

Super Dev Mode replaces the internals of Dev Mode (since v2.7) with a different approach that works better in modern browsers.
Like its predecessor, Super Dev Mode allows GWT developers to quickly recompile their code and see the results in a browser.
It also allows developers to use a debugger to inspect a running GWT application.

- With an ANT build we can use it by running:
> ant devmode
- With a Maven build we can run it by running:
> mvn gwt:devmode


## Debugging in IntelliJ

- Add a new Run/Debug Configuration of type 'JavaScript Debug'
- Give it a name and enter the URL of your GWT application, for example: 'http://127.0.0.1:8888/MyFirstGwtApp.html'
  (the one you get if you press 'Copy to Clipboard' in the 'GWT Development Mode' window running superDevMode)
- Choose a browser
- Add mapping(s) between your local files and remote URLs.
  e.g.: src/be/steven/d/dog/client -> 'http://127.0.0.1:8888/MyFirstGwtApp.html'
- While running superDevMode, use the newly created configuration to start debug mode in IntelliJ.


## Styling

For relatively simple AI we can use widgets for styling our app programmatically.

### UIBuilder

However, GWT also has a powerful tool called [UiBinder](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideUiBinder.html)
that allows you to create complex interfaces using declarative XML files, which can reduce code size and complexity.

### Elemento

GWT Elemento is a library which tries to make working with GWT Elemental as easy as possible.
In a nutshell Elemento brings the following features to the table:

Builder like API to easily create arbitrary large element hierarchies
HTML templates, declarative event handling and support for handlebar-like expressions
Support for dependency injection with GIN
Helper methods to mix and match GWT Elemental and GWT Widgets
In this blog post I will give a short introduction to some of Elementâ€™s features.

## Compiling Java to JavaScript

After using ant 'ant build' or 'mvn build' we can find all the files needed to deploy our web application to a public web server.


## Internationalization

Different techniques:
- Static String Internationalization
- Dynamic String Internationalization
- Localizable Interface
